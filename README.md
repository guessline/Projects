Project "Daily scooter rentals analysis". 

The Scenario

In this project, I work for a company that facilitates scooter-sharing.
Using these systems, users can rent a scooter in one place and return it to another.
Currently, there are hundreds of scooter programs around the world.
You will be given data about scooter rentals over a two-year period.

Goal of analysis
The goal will be to understand and predict daily scooter rentals using linear regression and to provide a visualization that will help the business manager better understand certain findings from the analysis.
